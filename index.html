<p><strong>Villa Badoer</strong> is a villa located in the Fratta Polesine in the Veneto region. 
Called "la Badoera", was designed for the noble Francesco Badoer by the architect <strong>Andrea Palladio</strong> in 1554 and built between the years 1556-1563. 
This villa had the function of supporting field's administration and showing the economic prestige of Francesco Badoer.
The villa, since 1996, has been part of the "UNESCO World Heritage Site".</p>

<p>The project in plasm focuses on representing the main building with particular attenction for the details of his structure components (rather than his forniture).
Every little parts, from the steps to the capitals, are designed with the aim to be as soon as possible similar to the original one.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>Hierarchical decomposition:
<ul>1. Base
<li>foundations</li>
<li>steps</li>
<li>rails</li>
</br>
2. Building
<li>walls</li>
<li>ledge</li>
<li>columns</li>
</br>
3. Top
<li>tympanum</li>
<li>guttae</li>
<li>roof</li>
</br>
4. Components
</ul>
Every hierarchical part is generated by a specific function.</p>

<h3>Plants & Documentation</h3>

<p>Though it's possible to find some plants on the web that isn't helpfull because of their incongruence between them. No proportion scale can be found and building's draw are never the same (see image below).
As consequence the proportion factor is chosen with large approssimation belonging it from the pictures. Morover these images are most of all photos taken from big distances, making impossible to reconstract a precise model.</p>

<h3>Base</h3>

<p> In the base part we can find the foundation, generated by the plasm function <code>SIMPLEX_GRID</code>,
the steps and the rails. For the steps a profile of a single step is created using a <code>BEZIER</code> curve, then this 
profile is projected for all the lenght of the step with the function <code>CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE</code>.
To draw a single rail more than a suppurt function is used, in particular a rail is decomposed in the base, the top and mullions. Each of these
components are implemented with subfunction. The first two are functions that generate a single component 
with a defined lenght in orizontal or oblique position without a rotation. 
This makes codes much more "light" even with a more defined domain. For the mullion there is
a function that generats a single mullion with a specific height using <code>ROTATIONAL_SURFACE</code>.

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>
The central part is composed by walls, columns and the ledge all around the building. For a single wall is used 
the function <code>TRIANGOLAR_DOMAIN</code> two times. For the ledge it's used a <code>NUBS</code> cerve to create the profile
and a <code>BEZIER</code> function to generate the entire ledge. A single column is drawn using NUBS and ROTATIONAL_SURFACE and replicated.
The capital is composed in two part each with two spiral. This spiral is obtained using the function <code>RULED_SURFACE</code>
 that shaps a NUBS profile with spiral's points. To join the two spiral obtained is used a BEZIER surface that tighs in the middle.
 To join the two parts is used a BEZIER.</p>
